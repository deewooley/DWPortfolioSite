            Hiking is an excellent activity that presents a unique opportunity for its participants to exercise, enjoy nature, socialize, and take a mental break from the chaos of everyday life. My goal was to create a product that inspires people to hike while simplifying the logistical requirements associated with planning group trips. 
           
           
            

<!-- There are many unique experiences that hiking can afford its participants, including gaining access to natural springs, bird
watching, dog walking, high quality views, and much more. -->

 <hr> 
    <h5>
        I have six main categories of people who we view as potential stakeholders. These groups are listed below:
<br>● Expert Hikers (Solo) - Description: Expert hikers are already highly motivated and hike regularly, often on more challenging trails.
<br>● Casual Hikers (Solo) -  Description: These are people who are already enthusiastic about hiking. They will already be hiking semi-regularly and have some experience choosing and preparing for different trails.
<br>● Beginners(Solo) - These are people who have little to no hiking experience. They are very new to hiking and may feel uneasy about hiking. Beginners may also include individuals looking to hike as part of another hobby, including activities for photographers, hunters, fishers, social media influencers, or bird watchers. These users are just trying to get started and may feel overwhelmed and intimidated by hiking. 
<br>● Families or Groups (Social Hikers) - This category includes people of all ages who like to hike in groups. People from any of the above three categories could also fit into this category. Social Hikers may encounter logistical concerns and might need to take into account a wide variety of preferences.
<br>● Suppliers - Description: Suppliers may include but are not limited to hiking equipment producers, hiking equipment vendors, clothing brands, and food and beverage producers. 
<br>● Parks and Trail Owners - Description: Anyone who owns hiking trails is part of this category. State parks and national parks will compose the majority of this group. Park and trail owners can benefit directly from our product. They would like their trails to be discovered and chosen by our users, so visibility and high ratings are important.

                <h5>  One individual interviewed has a friendly competition with a friend in a similar activity
                    to hiking, so we could see competition being a small factor for some users. Many interviewees
                    did not like using their phones during hikes. A few people liked to track their steps and calories
                    on the trail. Everyone liked hiking with at least a small group of friends, and all individuals interviewed stated that they like to hike because they enjoy being outdoors.

        <!-- Environment  <br>
        Hiking is generally done on public trails; however,
        these trails can often feel much more secluded than a typical public walking trail, which for
        many, is part of the appeal. With hiking often being performed far from human civilization, there is no guarantee of
        cell signal during hikes. This means that any information a hiker would need off the internet
        would need to be downloaded before the trip. During a hike, the number of interactions with
        people outside the hiking party will vary greatly depending on the trail and weather. With a
        popular trail in good weather, it can be difficult to ever find a truly secluded spot. On more
        difficult trails, or trails which are not as popular, it can sometimes feel like you and your
        companions are the only people for miles. Needless to say, the worse the weather gets, the fewer
        the people on the trail. -->

                        The key design criteria identified from our data are Convenience, Seclusion, Community, and Safety.
                 <br> <br> Convenience -  users want to find trails that are nearby and easy to access quickly. 
                They want to if the trail has the features and amenities that they want, trail difficulty, and level of preparedness needed so that they can find 
                an ideal path with little time and effort spent.
                <br>  <br> Seclusion - Hikers do not mind using technology in preparation of thei hike. However when on the trail; they want to be "in the 
                moment" and "aware of their surroundings" on the trail, often wanting to use technology as little as possible.
                <br>  <br>Community - My interviewees strongly prefer bonding with others on hikes and sharing unique outdoor 
                experiences. There may be friendly competition at times, but the technology needs to include a strong social component that encourages collaboration and 
                is easily accessible for both new and experienced hikers.Encourage groups of individuals to hike.
                <br>  <br> Safety - Some users were very invested in ensuring that their chosen trail was low-risk and that in case of an emergency they can receive assistance.

                        The goal was to keep the design criteria in mind and come up with as many judgement free ideas as possible, and
                       the primary technique used was reframing user problems and create solutions.

                          <br>  To select the final design concept, I looked at the Ideas generated, and analyzed them in terms of 
                                implementation feasibility. I then studied if different ideas satisfy market and user needs that are backed by our data. Finally, which concept follows our design criteria the
                                best? Community was the most importand design criteria, as determined from the data.
                            <br>
                            After creating the ideas I separated the ideas into main categories. I choose which categories were most relevant to our user and market needs. 
                            Green sticky noted indicate the most relevant categories, and the blue sticky notes beneath highlight the most relevant ideas. I thought that planning a group hiking event and finding people to join you in your hike, satisfied our design requirements and met unsatisfied needs. 
                        <br>
                        Finally, the Idea for HikeHerd was born and I began determining features and ultimately prototyping concepts.

<br>● Focus on Community and Convenience : Our interviewees
liked the social aspects of hiking, yet sometimes struggled with planning. This website will
provide features to the user to help them plan and obtain information regarding their hike in a centralized location.

<br><br>● Stakeholders : The most relevant stakeholders would be enthusiastic hikers looking to hike with
groups of individuals. Primarily this appeals to our John Walker persona, which includes
individuals that want to plan hikes with others, track progress, and belong to an enthusiastic
hiking-centered community. This app will likely appeal to enthusiastic hikers of ages 20-45.
<br><br>● Tech Innovation : There are no major social media or event planning and management sites
created around Hiking that we are aware of. This is a novel concept that helps bring people
together around their interest in hiking.

                                nature and social interaction to compliment the fitness aspect of hiking.
                                There are many unique experiences that hiking can afford its participants, including gaining access to natural springs, bird
    watching, dog walking, high quality views, and much more.      </h5>
