    <hr>
    <h5>Notably is a an application that allows users to take handwritten notes using an iPad and Apple Pencil.
        <br> I observed users using the popular Notably application as they used an iPad 12.9 and a first generation Apple Pencil. I observed them as they both wrote, drew, and typed their notes. 
        <br>Problems: Users can not write or change tools using their fingersl they can only use their fingers when interacting with the onscreen keyboard of if they are scrolling through their notes
        <br> The iPad, Apple Pencil, and Notably app work together and operate as a substitute for paper, pencil, pen, and highlighter user.

    <div id = "topic">
        <h1 id="toLeft">Product Stakeholders</h1>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <h5>Business Professionals - Business Professionals can use this application to record and organize work-related information.
            More specifically, they can take notes in meetings, while on phone calls or emails, create to-do
            lists, bullet talking point reminders, draft emails, or similar tasks. The Notably app offers
            benefits including that it is an environmentally friendly alternative to using paper and plastic
            pens, notes are easy to share with other devices and individuals, and it would be less likely that
            notes will be destroyed or lost.
            <br>
            Students - Students will use this app to take notes, capture audio recordings of lectures, organize their notes,
            and create to-do lists. This app will help students take, share, organize, and store their notes.
            Notably will also allow students to draw and add color to diagrams presented during lectures.
            <br>
            Lecturers/Educators - Lecturers will use this app to take notes for their classes or discussions and to help them
            create lists. This app can help educators record grades to allow them to record notes to
            self-critique. Finally, this app can also help them create to-do lists.
            <br>
            Home User (Taking Notes for Personal/General Life Use) - Home Users will use the app to accomplish everyday tasks, generally using paper and PostIts,
            including writing and sharing grocery lists, to-do lists, drafting emails, and similar tasks.
            <br>
            Writers - Writers will use this app to write their pieces and to create diagrams outlining their plot
            progressions, character archetypes, to-do lists, audio record, or write out brainstormed ideas.
            Writers can also use this app to send drafts to their computer to type them after handwriting
            them.
            <br>
            Digital Artists (Outside of Intended Usage) - Although this is not an intended use of note-taking applications, many artists can use notably to
            sketch drawings. Notably serves as an alternative to sketch pads and pencils and pens, and can
            allow artists to share their sketches seamlessly without needing to scan them, or use a Wacom
            tablet.
            <br>
            Audio Artist (Outside of Intended Usage) - Musicians can use the apps audio record features and write lyrics, sing, or record musical
            notation.

    </h1>
    <!-- <hr> -->
    <h5>The Stakeholder chosen was a student using the application to digitally write notes from a
        PowerPoint in a relatively noisy coffee shop and a quiet and private room in a library. Each
        interaction lasted 10 minutes, and we conducted two observations on the same day. </h5>

    <h1 id = "sectionHead">Documentation of Observation</h1>
    <h5>The subject used his iPad to review a PowerPoint, and the subject used my iPad, Apple Pencil,
        and Notably app to write notes, and my iPad used a screen recorder to capture every action taken
        for review. I sat at the table next to my subject and noted some of his actions. I noted facial
        expressions, and various gesture attempts to gain information about their experience. I did not
        want to look over my subject’s shoulder as he worked, because I wanted to record genuine and
        natural interactions with the device and application. I wanted to give some distance in both
        interactions.
<br>
        In general, the subjects’s facial expressions did not change as the interface is straightforward to
        navigate and use, he squinted an occasionally, but this was more to help him concentrate on how
        to paraphrase the notes than as a reflection of the app’s difficulty.</h5>

    <div id = "topic">
    <h1 id = "sectionHead">Observational Setting</h1>
    <h5>I observed a single subject twice once in a busy and relatively noisy coffeehouse, and a second
        time in a tranquil private library study space with soft classical music playing. Both interactions
        lasted 10 minutes, and in Observation 1, the subject had his first experience using an iPad and
        Apple pencil to write notes. At the coffee shop, the subject was seated at a small table in a
        wooden chair, and I sat facing him at the table to his left. I wanted to see his expressions and
        gestures so that I could review his physical actions and expressions later in the screen recorded
        video. He had a PowerPoint from one of his courses and took notes on a lesson. He used his iPad
        to review the PowerPoint presentation. The second observation took place in a private library
        study room; it was just the subject and me. We used the same technologies, and we had soft
        classical music playing to make the interaction less uncomfortable. I believed that complete
        silence would bring more self-awareness to the fact that he was being studied, and the addition of
        music would result in less obstructed data. I sat at the other end of the table about 3 ft away.
        Observation 1 took place around 12:50, and Observation 2 took place the same day at 5:30 pm.
     </h5>

    </div>

    <div id = "topic">
        <h1 id = "sectionHead">Interaction Description</h1>
        <h5>1A) The subject stopped attempting to erase errors after the first attempt. He tried to erase
            using the end of the Apple Pencil, which did not work, and the Eraser button is laborious to
            access and to reassess the pen tool afterwards. The subject opted to scratch out errors instead
            later stating that he would have erased them all at the same time at the end, but did not want to
            distract himself from taking notes by needing to access the eraser.
            <br> 1B) The subject tried to swipe left and right to navigate pages, this functionality is not
            available. He did this when trying to review notes, the screen orientation was vertical, as if using
            an e-reader.
            <br>1C) The subject decided to turn the iPad horizontally to write notes more naturally.
            Uniquely making the interaction more intuitive and similar to writing on paper or on a dry erase
            board.
            <br>2A) The subject attempted to use a SmartBoard eraser shortcut to erase information ie big
            circle and swiping through. This gesture did not produce any results
            <br>2B) The subject implements a cursive-esque printing style where he combines various
            letters in a single stroke. His ligature style of writing made it difficult to erase efficiently because
            it would erase chunks of words at a time, as opposed to a single letter.
            Davina Wooley
            <br>2C) The subject attempted to use the onscreen keyboard. The keyboard works with finger
            interaction and Apple Pencil interaction. Two hands were more efficient for typing. After typing
            with both hands, he wanted to highlight some of the text using his finger, but the functionality
            was unavailable. He had to pick up the Apple Pencil again to highlight a single word before
            reaccessing the keyboard to continue typing.</h5>

                be accessible by touch to decrease time requirement, as opposed to only pen interactions.
                <br> 3. Add functionality so that the subject does not have to lift the pen from the screen as often.
                The entire stroke should not be erased.
                <br>  4. Easier way to move from integrating touch input, digital keyboard input and Apple Pen

done, they can remove the visibility of the initial image. The user will be able to adjust the
visibility of the reference image manually throughout the design process.
2. Speech-to-Note Auto Generator (Adapt)(Prototype 1)- Users can record a speech, and the
system will analyze the audio input and take notes for the user. The text will appear faster than
the user would have been able to write or type them, and the user can highlight, and add media,
as they desire. This will allow the user to pay more attention to the lecture, and worry less about
catching every word. The user can record the lecture directly from an Apple Watch and edit it
from an iPad, or they can record the audio from the iPad itself. A single Notably Account will
link Apple watch and iPad applications, and they will all share notes and recordings
automatically from the time the user begins using adding content. The iPad does not need to be
within close proximity for the system to work. The original design for the Notable App will
remain, just the Apple Watch microphone or the iPad microphone may be populating the content
area. Recording and Note Taking can begin using Siri voice controls, and all information saves
to the Notably cloud.
3. Digital Notebook with animated page-turning and dog-ear features (Adapt) - This will
make the digital notebook seem more like a notebook. The animation will be reminiscent of
turning the physical page, and users can fold the corners of their pages to indicate that the
