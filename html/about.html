<!-- <p>
    Thanks for visiting my personal website. 
    <br>My name is Davina, but everyone calls me Dee, and I am an artist, programmer, and graduate student at Georgia Tech.
  <br> 
 
  I am currently working toward developing additional skills relating to UI/UX, Program Management, XR, LX and Graphic Design. 
  <br>
<br>
I have been interested in technology since I was 3 years old which is when I began taking computer classes. This passion lead me 
to an acceptance to Cab Calloway School of the Arts where I studied Communication Arts from 6th through 8th grade, and Digital Media 
from 9th through 12th. <br>
Following my matriculation, I attended Wilmington University where I completed an Accellerated Study Business Management Program and was able to graduate in two years. 
I then pursued my Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems at WilmU as well. 
I wanted to remain creative during my collegiate studies and decided to start a small freelancing multimedia company called WooleyMedia. 
Through WooleyMedia I worked as Photographer, Graphic Designer, and Videographer for various clients located in Philadelphia, NYC, France, Italy, and Turks and Caicos.

</p>
<p>
Why Art | Business | Tech: 
<br>
Art, Business, and Technology are my three greatest passions, and I am in equal parts creative, technical, and business oriented.<br>
I am interested in understanding the problems enncountered by individuals and organizations alike and working toward providing value by developing
transmedia solutions.

<br>Regardless of the creative medium; programming, film, XR, or design, 
I try to use my skills to intrigue, inform, and assist users. 

<br>

<br>
For fun: I enjoy watching films, reading, traveling, playing the drums, and taking care of my dog! 

<br>
<br>
For additional information regarding what I'm working on or learning, please refer to my Behance, GitHub, and Twitter Accounts.
<br>
Or you can just DM me on LinkedIn and ask (Whatever Floats). -->
