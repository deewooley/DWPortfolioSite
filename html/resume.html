<h1>About Me: </h1>
<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website. I am an artist and a programmer who enjoys creating projects that bring joy to their users. Regardless of the creative medium; programming, film, photography, or design, I try to use my skills to intrigue, inform, or assist users. 
     
    <br><br> I am both creative, technical, and business oriented.
    <br><br> <strong>For Fun:</strong> I enjoy watching films, reading, traveling, playing the drums, and taking care of my dog! 
    <br><br> I am currently working toward developing additional skills relating to Mobile App Development, Program Management, UI/UX, and  After Effects and Cinema 4D Animation. I am a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.
    <br><br> I am a very proud Delawarean, currently living in Atlanta, Georgia. </p>

<br>
<h1>Background</h1>
<br>
<p>I have been interested in technology since I was 3 years old when I began taking computer classes. This passion lead me to an acceptance to Cab Calloway School of the Arts where I studied Communication Arts from 6th through 8th grade, and Digital Media from 9th through 12th grade.
