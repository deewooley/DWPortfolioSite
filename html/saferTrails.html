    <h5> I developed both low-fidelity and high-fidelity mobile app prototypes for a web-based social media and hike planning platform called HikeHerd. Hike Herd originally began as low-fidelity prototype concept that I developed for a class.
         After the course concluded, I became very interested in pursuing my concept of HikeHerd further and this case study highlights the results. 
         This case study will outline how this final project was conceived, selected, and how the prototype was created.

        <hr>
      
        <h5>
            I chosen to develop a technological solution to assist hikers throughout the stages of the activity's life cycle. These stages include planning the hike, preparation, hiking, and concluding the event.
             Hiking is an excellent form of exercise and a unique opportunity to relax and take a mental break from the chaos of everyday life. 
             The goal was to create a product that inspires people by simplifying the work required to handle the hike's logistics and planning requirements. 
<br>
            Data was collected to gain information pertaining to why people choose to hike (or not hike).
             Once the data was collected, it was examined for patterns that could lead to insights that lead to us design opportunities. 
             The design implications derived from the data were our main focus throughout ideation. 
            Finally, we will design an effective and easy-to-use product that can provide value to hikers.

<!-- <br>
For many, part of the appeal of hiking is the opportunity to disconnect from the outside
world. As a result many trails are in rural locations and outside the range of any cell signal. This lack of signal can be both
a blessing and a curse, as most map applications need an internet connection to load high quality
maps of the user’s location. This lack of connectivity can also lead to safety concerns on long
trails, as sudden emergencies may be difficult to address without a chance to communicate with
first responders. -->

        <h1 id="toLeft">Executive Summary</h1>
        <!-- <hr> -->
        <h5>
    
            Our primary goal for this project is to motivate people to go outside and enjoy nature, ultimately
promoting hiking as a fun and healthy lifestyle addition.
 <!-- Hiking has been proven to help promote
both the physical and mental well-being of its participants. -->
There are a plethora of unique experiences that hiking can afford users, including gaining access to natural springs, bird
watching, dog walking, high quality views, and much more. 
Our solution will assist users in
selecting trails based on the user’s location, experience level, and interests. One secondary
goal is to simplify the task of finding hiking locations in and around the area specified by the
user. Another goal would be to help potential hikers find other individuals that would be
interested in hiking with them. This can create hiking centered communities and help hikers feel
safer while they are on their trail. There are many reasons why people choose not to hike; we
want to identify those major reasons and tailor a solution to make those excuses as weak as
possible, while also ensuring that the product remains as uplifting and encouraging as possible.
While there are plenty of ways to find a cardio regimen, but this program uses an appreciation of
nature and social interaction to compliment the fitness aspect of hiking.

                There are various mobile applications and web sites available that offer different services to hikers. One popular service for both
finding and mapping trails is AllTrails. 

<br>

                        No applications are offering services that are created for the purpose of helping hikers choose, and schedule hiking trips with their contacts or others. This application can bring ease to hikers which can result in a greater liklihood that they will hike and use the service. 
                        The goal is to minimize the users' logistical concerns, allowing them to focus on the hike more than the planning, scheduling, coordinating and communicating with others.

    <h1 id="toLeft">Stakeholders</h1>
    <!-- <hr> -->
    <h5>
        We have six main categories of people who we view as potential stakeholders. These groups are listed below:
<br>● Expert Hikers (Solo) - Description: Expert hikers are already highly motivated and hike regularly, often on more challenging trails.
<br>● Casual Hikers (Solo) -  Description: These are people who are already enthusiastic about hiking. They will already be hiking semi-regularly and have some experience choosing and preparing for different trails.
<br>● Beginners(Solo) - These are people who have little to no hiking experience. They are very new to hiking and may feel uneasy about hiking. Beginners may also include individuals looking to hike as part of another hobby, including activities for photographers, hunters, fishers, social media influencers, or bird watchers. These users are just trying to get started and may feel overwhelmed and intimidated by hiking. 
<br>● Families or Groups (Social Hikers) - This category includes people of all ages who like to hike in groups. People from any of the above three categories could also fit into this category. Social Hikers may encounter logistical concerns and might need to take into account a wide variety of preferences.
<br>● Suppliers - Description: Suppliers may include but are not limited to hiking equipment producers, hiking equipment vendors, clothing brands, and food and beverage producers. 
<br>● Parks and Trail Owners - Description: Anyone who owns hiking trails is part of this category. State parks and national parks will compose the majority of this group. Park and trail owners can benefit directly from our product. They would like their trails to be discovered and chosen by our users, so visibility and high ratings are important.

            Data through a mix of phone interviews, online questionnaires, and
online research. We will also study previously existing products that have relevance to our
problem to get a better idea of what is already out there and what could be improved. Other
potential research questions are listed below:
<br>● What are the excuses people use to avoid hiking?
<br>● Besides hiking, what do hikers like to do on their “hiking trips” (e.g. climbing, kayaking,
biking, camping, etc.)? Are there differences between the activities of more/less
dedicated hikers? Why?
<br>● How often do most “hikers” hike throughout the year, and what factors motivate their
decisions?
<br>● How many hiking trips do they schedule, participate in, and cancel each year? Why?
<br>● What are the factors used to determine which trail they choose (location, difficulty, the
time required to complete trail vs. time available to hikers, views, landmarks, etc.)?
<br>● In what other ways do hikers exercise outdoors? Indoors? How do they rank and choose
their activities?

        <!-- Environment  <br>
        Hiking is generally done on public trails; however,
        these trails can often feel much more secluded than a typical public walking trail, which for
        many, is part of the appeal. With hiking often being performed far from human civilization, there is no guarantee of
        cell signal during hikes. This means that any information a hiker would need off the internet
        would need to be downloaded before the trip. During a hike, the number of interactions with
        people outside the hiking party will vary greatly depending on the trail and weather. With a
        popular trail in good weather, it can be difficult to ever find a truly secluded spot. On more
        difficult trails, or trails which are not as popular, it can sometimes feel like you and your
        companions are the only people for miles. Needless to say, the worse the weather gets, the fewer
        the people on the trail. -->

                <h5>
                 The key themes identified from our data are convenience, seclusion, community, and safety.
                 <br>  ● The first of these themes, convenience, comes from our data indicating that users want to find trails that are nearby and easy to access quickly. 
                They want to immediately know the features of these trails, including amenities, difficulty, and level of preparedness needed so that they can find 
                an ideal path with little time and effort spent.
                <br>  ● The second theme, seclusion, is an extension of what our interviewees have stated about technology as it relates to hiking. They want to be "in the 
                moment" and "aware of their surroundings" on the trail, often wanting to use technology as little as possible during the hike.
                <br>  ● The third theme, community, reflects how our interviewees like to hike. They strongly prefer bonding with others on hikes and sharing unique outdoor 
                experiences. There may be friendly competition at times, but the technology needs to include a strong social component that encourages collaboration and 
                is easily accessible for both new and experienced hikers.
                <br>  ● Our final theme is safety - while many people just wanted a fun trail, some users were very interested in ensuring that their chosen trail was low-risk.

                    Simplicity While Remaining Effective
                        <br>Secondly, we want to keep our product as simple as possible. This means we want to have as few
                        buttons on screen as we can while still providing the necessary functionality and maintaining usability. To
                        accomplish this, we need to carefully think through what functionalities the user will need and how we
                        can best present those functionalities to the user. When comparing two designs, if one is able to present
                        the same capabilities to the user with less clutter onscreen than the other, the simpler design will be
                        favored over the more complicated design. An easy way to measure simplicity is to count the number of
                        buttons on the screen. As long as we do not sacrifice functionality, fewer buttons is better. We do need to
                        be careful with this criteria, however, as it could result in simple tasks requiring several screens to access.
                        This means we need to minimize the buttons per screen while still trying to satisfy the competing criteria
                        of minimizing the number of screens required for completing a task. The best designs will find a balance
                        between the two.
                        <br>   Safety
                        <br>  The final research theme is a need for safety on the trail. One of our personas from the previous
                        assignment, Belinda, likes to hike with her young son. Because of this, she often likes to hike on trails she
                        knows are safe, with access to nearby civilization and a lack of rough terrain. With this in mind, we would
                        like to include some form of safety information in our product. This information could include warnings
                        for natural hazards such as large cliffs, dangerous rivers, and hazardous wildlife, as well as other potential
                        problems such as rough trails, bad cell service, and lack of access to emergency assistance. A successful
                        implementation of this idea will result in the user feeling secure and informed in their choice of trails,
                        knowing that they are not going somewhere where things could easily go wrong. A good design provides
                        as much useful information as possible without overloading the user with more data than they can easily
                        digest.

                        There were 2 ideation sessions that both spanned 45 minutes.   
                        The goal was to keep the design criteria in mind and come up with as many judgement free ideas as possible. 
                        Different techniques were used ranging from reframing problems that users have with hiking and creating solutions. 
                        Some were serious, others were strange or funny. But all helped reframe user needs into viable technological solutions. 
                        Example: Some users are afraid of coming into contact with dangerous wildlife. Solution: Create an application that alerts users of trails where
                        dangerous wildlife have recently been spotted. OR Some users might like the sense of danger, Create an Augmented Reality Application that adds danger to the hike, ie the user is being chased by a mountain lion and they have to escape.

accounts. Users can browse potential hiking locations in the locations tab and view geotagged
photos posted by other users in the user photos tab. The site also hosts a blog where users can
post about their hikes, critique trails, and offer helpful tips. They can send and receive messages
from other users. On the dashboard, users can view their calendar, browse hikes by location, and
view trail features, optionally limiting results to events shared by contacts or public events posted
to the community at large. The user can read about each hike and note whether or not they are
interested in going. All input is shared in the hikes log below. If a user selects “Going”, it will be
added to the user’s calendar. Each user will have their own profile, displaying photos, hiking
qualitative metrics, and preferences. Profiles can be public or private (viewable by contacts only).
They can add friends as contacts and manage groups of friends into hiking groups, where
members can message each other and coordinate details pertaining to their hiking event. Users
can list favorite locations and obtain information regarding events in those locations, manage
contacts, and follow certain users’ blog entries. Finally, users can search through the site’s
contents to find users and hiking locations.
<br>● Focus : This website addresses the Community and Convenience design trends. Our interviewees
liked the social aspects of hiking, yet sometimes struggled with planning. This website will
provide features to the user to help them plan and obtain information regarding their hike, manage
hiking events with friends, find trails that meet their requirements, and meet like-minded
individuals. All of this is obtained by means of a free, simple, easy, and convenient platform
dedicated to streamlining the hiking planning process and fostering community.
<br>● Stakeholders : The most relevant stakeholders would be enthusiastic hikers looking to hike with
groups of individuals. Primarily this appeals to our John Walker persona, which includes
individuals that want to plan hikes with others, track progress, and belong to an enthusiastic
hiking-centered community. This app will likely appeal to enthusiastic hikers of ages 22-50.
<br>● Tech Innovation : There are no major social media or event planning and management sites
created around Hiking that we are aware of. This is a novel concept that helps bring people
together around their interest in hiking, and it helps users find their ideal trails.
<br>● Supported Activity : This solution aims to get people hiking with other individuals. Managing
individuals, managing events, and obtaining information can be difficult. This site eases the
process by helping users collaborate with contacts and meet new people so that individuals who
want to hike with others can do so.</h5>

            <br>Our research has shown that users are concerned about the overall safety of unknown trails when
            planning a hiking trip. We want our prototype to keep track of danger by offering users the ability to view
            reported hazards on a distant trail. This will let users scout out a trail so they can find confirmed and
            potential hazards before making their decision. Hike planners are the primary stakeholders, as they will
            directly benefit from knowing what trails meet their safety standards, while the hikers who accompany
            them are also affected by the decision of what trail to hike, which is assisted by the knowledge of what
            could await them on each trail. </h5>
