<h1>DAVINA 'DEE' WOOLEY</h1>

<h1>About Me: </h1>
<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I am an artist and a programmer who enjoys creating projects that bring joy and value to users. Regardless of the creative medium; programming, film, photography, or design, I try to use my skills to intrigue, inform, or assist users. 
     <br>
     I am a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.
    <br><br> I am both creative, technical, and business oriented.
    <br><br> <strong>For Fun:</strong> I enjoy watching films, reading, traveling, playing the drums, and taking care of my dog! 
    <br><br> I am currently working toward developing additional skills relating to Program Management, UI/UX, VFX, 3D and VR/AR Technologies.
