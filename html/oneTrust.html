            <br>Scope- Purpose of project and established expectations
            E-learning is learner centric and LMS interactive capabilities present additional opportunities for Interactive Design.
            It is essentially interactive and immersive film and graphic design created for the  purpose of educating the audience. This medium presents a multitude of opportunties, and I want to create an active, fun and engaging learning experience.

        time in a tranquil private library study space with soft classical music playing. Both interactions
        lasted 10 minutes, and in Observation 1, the subject had his first experience using an iPad and
        Apple pencil to write notes. At the coffee shop, the subject was seated at a small table in a
        wooden chair, and I sat facing him at the table to his left. I wanted to see his expressions and
        gestures so that I could review his physical actions and expressions later in the screen recorded.

            using the end of the Apple Pencil, which did not work, and the Eraser button is laborious.

            available. He did this when trying to review notes, the screen orientation was vertical, as if using
